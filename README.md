**STEAL!** is an online marketplace focused on selling Content Distribution Keys (CDKs). It offers a secure, user-friendly platform for gamers seeking affordable game keys, aiming to become the top destination for accessible, high-quality digital gaming.

> **"SO AFFORDABLE IT'S LIKE STEALING!"** 

----


## A1: STEAL!

### Goals, Business Context, and Environment

STEAL! aims to be a website where gamers can buy Content Distribution Keys (CDKs), which can be activated on game platforms like Steam, Uplay, and Origin. Competing with other online gaming stores, STEAL! focuses on providing a smooth user experience, competitive prices, and a wide range of games for both casual and dedicated gamers.

### Motivation

The increased demand for video games has made STEAL! possible by providing affordable game keys in an easy and safe manner, attracting a wide range of gamers.

### Main Features

STEAL! provides advanced search and filtering options, making it easy for users to find their desired games. It also offers personalized game recommendations based on users' preferences for those unsure of what to play next. 

Recognizing that our users are the foundation of our success, we reward them with **S coins**, which can be used in the store. Additionally, users can create wishlists to save their favorite games and take advantage of special sales when they occur.

### User Profiles

STEAL! accommodates four distinct user profiles: 
- **Anonymous Users:** can browse products without registration, allowing them to explore the marketplace before deciding whether to create an account. 
- **Buyers:** are registered users who can browse products, purchase CDKs, and engage with the platform through wishlists and reviews. 
- **Sellers:** are users who list games for sale and manage their product information and pricing, but they cannot buy products on the platform. 
- **Administrators:** have full control over the platform, managing product listings, user accounts, and overseeing order processing to ensure smooth operations; however, they also cannot make purchases. 

Together, these user profiles create a dynamic marketplace that fosters interaction and supports the gaming community.

| BR03 | Deleted Item History |  The history of an item must be maintained, even if the item is deleted, to preserve the sales record for all items. |
| BR04 | Purchase Confirmation | Buyers must confirm their purchase before payment is processed. After confirmation, no changes or cancellations can be made. |

## A3: Information Architecture

> The following artifact provides a brief overview of the system's architecture. This overview facilitates a more in-depth identification and description of user requirements, as well as the methodical planning of the system's interface.

This artifact includes two key elements:

- 1. Sitemap – This element presents a brief and concise organization of the system's interface.
- 2. Wireframes – These elements provide a simple overview of selected system interface pages. They help define functionality and describe content placement and organization. A minimum of two wireframes will be included in this section.


### 1. Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationships between the pages within a system's interface, illustrating how information is organized and connected. It identifies all unique pages in the system and shows how they are structured and related to each other.

The STEAL! system is divided into six main page types:

- Static pages: Provide general information about the system.
- Authentication pages: Allow unauthenticated users to create an account or log in.
- Item pages: Accessible by all users to view details and interact with CDKs (codes or products) available in the system.
- Client pages: Reserved for buyers (client users), enabling actions related to purchasing.
- Seller pages: Exclusively for sellers to list, manage, and sell CDKs.
- Admin pages: Reserved for system administrators to manage user accounts, product listings, and handle user reports or complaints.

In the following sitemap, all pages in STEAL!'s interface are displayed as small rounded boxes and grouped by their type (e.g., static, authentication, client). Black lines represent direct navigational paths between pages. Some pages with the exact same functionality and organization that can have different instances per user such as the CDK info pages are represented by a stack of pages.

**Figure 2:** STEAL! sitemap.



### 2. Wireframes

> Wireframes for, at least, two main pages of the web application.
> Do not include trivial use cases (e.g. about page, contacts).
