            STEAL! offers a powerful search and filtering system that helps users easily find the games they want. You can manage your selections with a shopping cart and enjoy a personalized profile that keeps track of your purchase history and wishlist. If you're unsure what to play next, we also provide tailored game recommendations based on your preferences. Additionally, users can leave reviews for games they've purchased to help others make informed decisions.

        <p>
            We've partnered with multiple game companies to list their titles directly on our platform, offering a wide and diverse selection of games. Users can sign in using their STEAL! account or log in via Google for a seamless authentication process.

            Authenticated users with games on their wishlist will receive real-time notifications about discounts and special offers, so they never miss a great deal. Our platform also supports multiple payment methods, allowing users from around the world to make purchases in their preferred way for a more convenient shopping experience.

        <p>
            As a token of appreciation, we reward our users with S coins, which can be used to get discounts on future game purchases. When you buy a game, you earn a percentage of your payment back in S coins. These coins can be applied to reduce the price of your next game, making your shopping experience more rewarding and cost-effective.
